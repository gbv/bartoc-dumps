         "\"EcoLexicon is a terminological resource developed by the LexiCon Research Group at the University of Granada.\nEcoLexicon represents the conceptual structure of the specialized domain of the Environment in the form of a visual thesaurus. This thesaurus has been elaborated according to the theoretical premises of Frame-Based Terminology. Consequently, each concept appears in the context of a specialized frame that highlights its relation to other concepts, and makes explicit its designations in English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, and Greek. Through the convergence of conceptual, linguistic and graphical information, EcoLexicon meets the needs of different users groups (people interested in the Environment, students, translators, technical writers, etc.).\""
